              <h1>Started working at Braudes Pharmacy</h1>
              <p>
                My time at Braudes was good and I appreciated every thing that I have experienced there. I learnt how to manage money for the first time, 
                I learnt most of my communication skills there as well, and I could see what its like to work for the first time to actually experience what the real world is like.
                I started as a front shop assistant where I would just ask if people need assistance with finding specific items displpayed in the front shop. This helped me with people skills 
                and it also made me broaden my knowledge on medicine. Then from there I started working at the till as a cashier, which helped me with time management and aswell as money management. 
                I also took this time communicating to practice my sales skills.

              <h1>Started Improving my Matric results</h1>
              <p>
                At first I wanted to study medicine, but I soon found out that it was not my passion, I was introduced to
                anaconda which is a learning tool for python, and after that I decided that I want to persue a career as a 
                developer, but the subjects I matriculated with did not allow me to. Thats when I decided to
                upgrade my matric results by adding two subjects that I never knew anything about, Mathematics pure and physical
                science. I learnt to persevere and to set a goal for myself, Because I was busy working in order to pay for my tuition
                fees and this resulted in me working night shifts as well as most weekends as well.

              <p>
                I wrote my exams and failed. Although I was sad because I had sacrificed a lot, I reapplied to do the subjects again
                because I did not yet reach my goal of being a developer.

                My contract at Braudes pharmacy came to an end and I was without a job. I learned what it meant to have

                I then decided to use my savings that I have saved up from the time I was working at Braudes 
                to enroll myself at an institute to better myself at maths and physics. 
                This was a tough time but I learnt what it meant to make sacrifices for what I wanted to achieve.

                I got a casual job offer to work as a sales assistant at Mr Tekkie. during my time at Mr Tekkie
                I learnt to never give up because I had to make sales in order to recieve a good amount of money. The sales industry
                is very stressful because we have to reach monthley targets. I also learnt what its really like to work in a team, this 
                helped me with my communication skills, I learned what is meant to be a team player, to not be selfish and to always make 
                sure everyone is on the same page. Because the staff was small, I learned management skills, because I offered to clean the 
                store and make sure the store was presentable, I was also required to market the different products in store. I also learned 
                how to manage my time.

                My friend told me about WeThinkCode_ and I was shocked and amaized to find out that studying computer science 
                was not the only way to become a developer. I applied and made it to the WeThinkCode_ bootcamp, where I learned 
                and understand more about programming in python.

                I passed the bootcamp and successfuly made it into the WeThinkCode_. At WeThinkCode_ I learned a lot, I learned 
                eveything it means to be a the best developer. A good developer must never give up, must always be humble, 
                and must be a good team player. I learned a different way of learning and I learned how to teach aswell. during the 
                year my friend and I volunteered to host workshops for the students and we shared our knowledge with our peers because 
                WeThinkCode_ is a peer to peer learning enviroment. This helped me articulate what I have learned and it helped me with 
                public speaking aswell. I also had more experience with team work where I learned to implement what WeThinkCode_ tought
                us about agile development where I would break my problems in smaller managable problems. I learned everything that I know 
                at WeThinkCode_.
